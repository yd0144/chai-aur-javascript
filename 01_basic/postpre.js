//For postfix
// let a=10
// let b=a++         //Here we 1st assign value to b so it will take b as 10 and after that it will increment and that value is stored in a
// console.log(a);   
// console.log(b);

let c=20
let d=++c        //Here we 1st increment value of c and then assign to d and that value is stored in c also so value in c and d is same
