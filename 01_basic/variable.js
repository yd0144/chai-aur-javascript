/* variable is noting but giving a name to memeory location.
Here we are declaring and assiging values to variable .if we are not assigned any value to variable then it will take as undefined.
We can declare variable in 2 ways one is using let and another one is var but var is not prefer to use because it does not have block and functional scope and 
another thing with var is that we can redeclare same variable with var but with let we cannot do it. let is perfer to use.
 we can assign value to variable without let or without var but it is not good practice

//above program we used table method this is good to use when printing many variables in same time it will dispaly table with index and value column
